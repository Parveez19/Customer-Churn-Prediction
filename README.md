Customer Churn Prediction – ML Web App

This project is an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts the probability of customer churn for a telecom service provider.
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), explainability using SHAP, and a fully interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

The app allows users to enter customer details and instantly get:

Churn probability (0–100%)

Stay/Leave prediction

Model-driven insights

The project demonstrates practical ML skills: handling categorical/numerical features, building robust pipelines, optimizing models, and deploying a real ML model for public use.d
